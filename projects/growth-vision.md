<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>This application is designed to track any investments a user makes and predict their potential growth. The prediction is based on polynomial regressionâ€”the more investment values there are, the more accurate the prediction will be. The application can also run basic simulations, allowing you to add investments and see how they might grow over time based on a given period and growth rate.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: The predictions generated by this application are based solely on mathematical calculations and do not take current economic conditions into account. Please consider them as estimates rather than guarantees of future performance.</p>

<p>This project was very interesting to work on because I learned a lot of new things. The first thing I learned was GitHub Actions. Although I was already familiar with CI/CD and Jenkins, I had only heard of GitHub Actions but never used it. This project was a great opportunity to explore it and see how easy it is to set up and use when working with a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The second thing I learned was how to use other Angular libraries, such as <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> and <a href="https://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-calendar/#/kitchen-sink">Angular Calendar</a>. I conducted in-depth research on these two libraries to customize them and integrate them into my projec.</p>
<p>The final new concept I applied in this project was Clean Code. I had just finished reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin before starting this project, and I made a strong effort to follow the best practices outlined in the book (SOLID principles, clear and meaningful variable/method/class names, minimal lines per method, etc.). This project was also a great opportunity to practice these principles and see the benefits they bring.</p>

<h3> Features </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Follow your investment by adding the current value of your investment</li>
    <li>After a minimum of 3 values added for an investment, a prediction will be calculated (based on polynomial regression)</li>
    <li>Simulate the evolution of an or several investments, and see the evolution based on compound interests</li>
    <li>Authentication</li>
    <li>Several ways to follow your investments values (Calendar) and the evolution (Charts)</li>
